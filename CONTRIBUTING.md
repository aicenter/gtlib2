# Contributing

This file describes setup necessary to contribute to the `master` branch of the library.

Please submit merge requests to gitlab.

<!--
todo:
There is a CI pipeline which checks tests, they must first pass before the pull request can be merged to master.

At least one additional thumbs up must be made by another maintainer of the library to approve the pull request and subsequent merge to master.

## Practical advice

Domains - coding of observations etc. with binary flags!
beware: Danger of overflow!

## Development guide

Your code should read like a book. If it doesn't, do it again.

Generally follow the Zen of Python:

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Code style

Use Google Code Style:

- Clion: Settings -> Code style -> GoogleStyle 
- other editors: https://github.com/google/styleguide 
  - eclipse: look up `eclipse-cpp-google-style.xml`

Use indentation of 4 spaces.

## Committing code

In CLion, turn on

- [x] Reformat code (only if you have used the ^^ code style!)
- [x] Rearrange code
- [x] Optimize imports
- [x] Perform code analysis

Especially, deal with the problems that turn up with code analysis! 

### Linter

cpplint - cpplint.py is a tool that reads a source file and identifies many (Google c++) style errors. It is not perfect, and has both false positives and false negatives, but it is still a valuable tool. False positives can be ignored by putting // NOLINT at the end of the line or // NOLINTNEXTLINE in the previous line. You can install it via pip: 

    pip install cpplint
    
Then just call

    cpplint source_file.cpp
    
Setup CLion to use the linter automatically:

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7871-clion-cpplint

Follow the installation instructions (locate python and cpplint.py)
Mine was located in:

    /home/michal/.python_envs/gt/bin/python
    /home/michal/.python_envs/gt/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cpplint.py

Set linter options to:

    --linelength=100 --verbose=0

## Header files
Please put following in your automatic header file:

How to:  

- Clion / Intellij Idea:
  `Settings / Editor / File and Code Templates / Includes / File Header (adjusting the header of the class)`
- Eclipse: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604424/how-can-i-add-a-default-header-to-my-source-files-automatically-in-eclipse
  
## Profiling code

You may want to profile your code. You can use valgrind:

    cd cmake-build-debug
    valgrind --tool=callgrind ./main [arguments]

It will produce files `callgrind.out.#` which can be opened and analyzed in `KCacheGrind` utility. 

## Implementing domains

For a reference example how to implement a domain please take a look at `domains/goofSpiel.h`, `domains/goofSpiel.cpp`

Each domain must pass automatic test evaluation -- please write several instances of your domains and add them to `tests/domainsTest.cpp`

You should understand the basic model of how domains work, see "High-level overview" in `README.md`.

Each domain must implement:

- Domain class, for example `GoofSpielDomain` deriving from `Domain`:
    - In constructor, you have to call the parent.
    - You need to specify maximum state depth `maxDepth_`, number of players `numberOfPlayers_`, maximum achievable utility in any leaf `maxUtility_`, root outcomes via `rootStatesDistribution_`.
    
- State class, for example `GoofSpielState` deriving from `State`:
    - State must be able to initialize as root state, or continuation of previous state.
    - Implement all pure virtual functions.
    
- Action class, for example `GoofSpielAction` deriving from `Action`:
    - Action ids must be unsigned integers that are in range `0..N-1`
      and must be consistenly the same within the same infoset, 
      i.e. action with for example `id=0` in history `h` must be the same 
      action also in `h'` if `h,h' \in I` 
    - The function returning list of available actions must return 
      them in a vector `v` where `v[i] == ActionId(i)` i.e. action at 
      index `i` of the returned vector must have the action id of 
      value `i`.

- Observation class, for example `GoofSpielObservation` deriving from `Observation`:
    - Observation id must be unique within the subsequence 
      `(h -> chance outcomes ->Â h')` if player has received different observations.
