     *      1 iterate of budget becomes up to 101 iterations of algorithm, according to probability of selected node.
     *
     * 2) useBelief DOES NOT AFFECT usual ISMCTS algorithm, only CPW_ISMCTS, as it requires IS -> nodes map.
     *
     * When useBelief = true, if current infoset contains multiple number of nodes,
     * after the choosing randomly a node to iterate, algorithm makes up to 101 iterations,
     * according to the probability of the selected node (n = 1 + prob*100).
     * If there is only one node in the infoset, it will be iterated 101 times.
     *
     * Probability of the node counted as a multiplication of all probabilities,
     * that lead from the previous infoset to the current node.
     * If there are multiple ways from the old infoset to the node, they are summed.
     * In the end, probabilities for all nodes are normalized (see setCurrentInfoset and fillBelief at CPW_ISMCTS).

 * Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm (ISMCTS) is based on the MCTS algorithm,
 * with a changes that allow it to work with imperfect information games.
 *
 * Algorithm is described in "Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search" paper (Cowling, Powley and Whitehouse, 2012)
 * and improved in "Monte Carlo Tree Search in Imperfect-Information Games" doctoral thesis by Viliam LisÃ½.
 *
 * Just like the MCTS, algorithm has following steps: selection, expansion, simulation and backpropagation.
 * Unlike the MCTS, the ISMCTS tree consists of the information sets,
 * which are the unions of the nodes with the same action-observation histories.
 *
 * In this algorithm, in every iteration the tree search starts from the root of the tree,
 * no matter of the current state of the games. It allows the algorithm not to store the map IS -> nodes.
 * The downside is that this algorithm is more likely to reach undiscovered infoset.
 *
 * The more advanced version - CPW_ISMCTS - iterates the tree down from the current infoset.
 * Using belief makes this algorithm even more consistent against non-random strategies.
