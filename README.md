###Install

Since we use c++17, you will need cmake 3.8 or newer to build the project. Your IDE may have it bundled. If you want to use the standard ubuntu package, you will need Ubuntu 17.10 or newer.

We also need boost:

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-system-dev
```
